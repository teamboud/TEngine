# TEngine
Again theodore alone. I have been working on this game engine for quite a while but stopped further development. I may be revisiting this project though


It is written in Java and uses the LightWeightJavaGameLibrary(LWJGL) library for opengl the same one used in Minecraft!
Developed with Eclipse
